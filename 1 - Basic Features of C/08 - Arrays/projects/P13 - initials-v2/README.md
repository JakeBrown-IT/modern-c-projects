Section 08 - Arrays // Project 13

Modify Programming Project 11 from Chapter 7 s othat the program labels it's output:
```
Enter a first and last name: Lloyd Fosdick
You entered the name: Fosdick, L.
```
The program will need to store the last name (but not the first name) in an array of characters until it can be printed. You may assume that the last name is no more than 20 characters long.
