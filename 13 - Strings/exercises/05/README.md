# Section 13 Exercise 05

(a) Write a function named `capitalize` that capitalizes all letters in its argument. The argument will be a null-terminated string containing arbirary characters, not just letters. Use array subscripting to access the characters in the string. Hint: Use the `toupper` function to convert each character to upper-case.

(b) Rewrite the `capitalize` function, this time using pointer arithmetic to access the characters in the string.
