# Section 13 Project 05

Write a program named `sum.c` that adds its command-line arguments, which are assumed to be integers. Running the program by typing

```text
sum 8 24 62
```

should produce the following output:

```text
Total: 94
```

Hint: Use the `atoi` function to convert each command-line argument from string form to integer form.
