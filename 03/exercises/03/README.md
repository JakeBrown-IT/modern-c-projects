# Section 03 Exercise 03

For each of the following pairs of `scanf` format strings, indicate whether or not the two strings are equivalent. If they're not, show how they can be distinguished.

(a) `"%d"`       versus `" %d"`
(b) `"%d-%d-%d"` versus `"%d -%d -%d"`
(c) `"%f"`       versus `"%f "`
(d) `"%f,%f"`    versus `"%f, %f"`


# Solution

(a) Equivalent
(b) Equivalent
(c) Not Equivalent - User needs to enter a non-whitespace character to signify the end of the input.
(d) Equivalent
