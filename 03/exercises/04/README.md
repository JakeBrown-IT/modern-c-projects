# Section 03 Exercise 04

Suppose that we call `scanf` as follows:
```c
scanf("%d%f%d", &i, &x, &j);
```
If the user enters
```text
10.3 5 6
```
what will be the values of `i`, `x`, and `j` after the call? (Assume that `i` and `j` are `int` variables and `x` is a `float` variable.)


# Solution

`i = 10`, `x = 0.3`, `j = 5`.
