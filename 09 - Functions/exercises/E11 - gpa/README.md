# Functions Exercise 11

Write the following function:

```c
float compute_GPA(char grades[], int n);
```

The `grades` array will contain letter grades (A, B, C, D, or F, either upper-case or lower-case); `n` us the length of the array. The function should return the average of the grades (assume that `A = 4`, `B = 3`, `C = 2`, `D = 1`, and `F = 0`).
