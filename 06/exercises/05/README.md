# Section 06 Exercise 05

Which one of the following statements is not equivalent to the other two (assuming thatthe loop bodies are the same)?

(a) `while (i < 10) { ... }`
(b) `for (; i < 10;) { ... }`
(c) `do { ... } while (i < 10);`


# Solution

(c) is not equivalent to (a) and (b) as the `do` statement will always run at least oncebefore evaluating the `while` condition.
