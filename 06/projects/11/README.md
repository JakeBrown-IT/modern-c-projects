# Section 06 Project 11

The value of the mathematical constant `e` can be expressed as an infinite series:
```text
e = 1 + 1/1! + 1/2! + 1/3! + ...
```
Write a program that approximates `e` by computing the value of
```text
1 + 1/1! + 1/2! + 1/3! + ... + 1/n!
```
where `n` is an integer entered by the user.
