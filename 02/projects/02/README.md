# Section 02 Project 02

Write a program that computes the volume of a sphere with a 10-meter radius, using the formula $v = \frac{4}{3} \pi r^{3}$. Write the fraction $\frac{4}{3}$ as `4.0f / 3.0f`. (Try writing is as `4/3`. What happens?) Hint: C doesn't have an exponentiation operator, so you'll need to multiply $r$ by itself twice to compute $r^{3}$.
