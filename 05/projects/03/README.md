# Section 05 Project 03

Modify the `broker.c` program of Section 5.2 by making both of the following changes:
(a) Ask the user to enter the number of shares and the price per share, instead of the value of the trade.
(b) Add statements that compute the commission charged byy a rival broker ($33 plus 3c per share for fewer than 2000 shares; $33 plus 2c per share for 2000 shares or more). Display the rival's commission as well as the commission charged by the original broker.
