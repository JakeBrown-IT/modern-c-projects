# Section 18 Exercise 07

Suppose that we declare `x` to be a `const` object. Which one of the following statements about `x` is false?

(a) If `x` is of type `int`, it can be used as the value of a case label in a `switch` statement.
(b) The compiler will check that no assignment is made to `x`.
(c) `x` is subject to the same scope as the variables.
(d) `x` can be of any type.


# Solution

(c) is false, `x` is only subject to the same scope rules as variables, not just the same scopes.
